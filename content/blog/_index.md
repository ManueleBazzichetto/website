#### **Disclaimer**: I am 100% self-taught in stats (and in R as well). So, please read my posts with due caution. I am writing this blog to have ideas, concepts, intuitions fixed somewhere. I also hope that the content will help others without a background in statistics (like me) become more familiar with topics that can often be hard to grasp (at least, they are for me). I welcome comments, critics, suggestions, and any other interactions that can help improve the blog's content. To reach me, visit the [home page](https://mbazzichetto.netlify.app) and choose your preferred contact method. Thanks for reading!
