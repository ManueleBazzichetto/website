**Disclaimer**: I am 100% self-taught in stats (actually, in R as well). So, read my posts with due caution. I am writing this blog to have ideas, concepts, intuitions fixed somewhere. Also, I like to think that the content of this blog will help people who do not have a background in statistics (like me) to get familiar with topics that are generally hard to grasp (at least, they are to me). I welcome comments, critics, suggestions and all sort of interactions that can improve the content of this blog.
