My name is Manuele Bazzichetto. I am a vegetation ecologist broadly interested in biological invasions, biogeography, species distribution modelling, and, from recently, on the effect of climatic anomalies on ecosystem stability.

Since October 2022, I am a MSCA (Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions) fellow at the [*MOBI lab*](https://petrkeil.github.io) (Dpt. of Spatial Science, Czech University of Life Sciences), where I will be investigating with Petr Keil how extreme climatic events affect the temporal stability of vegetation communities. Our project is named [*COCOS*](https://mbazzichetto.netlify.app/cocos/) (effects of Climatic extremes On eCOsystem Stability), and I will be posting news and info about it.
