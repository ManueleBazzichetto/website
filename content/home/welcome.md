I am a vegetation ecologist with a broad interest in understanding what drives vegetation patterns and processes across space and time. My research has focused on several aspects, including biological invasions, the role of anthropogenic and natural factors in shaping plant diversity patterns in different ecosystem types, and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem's response to extreme climatic events.

From 2022 to 2024, I was a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at the [*MOBI lab*](https://petrkeil.github.io) at the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. There, I ran [*COCOS*](https://mbazzichetto.netlify.app/cocos/), which aimed at investigating how extreme climatic events affect the temporal stability of vegetation-related functions, such as plan biomass. Want to know more about COCOS? [*Visit this page*](https://mbazzichetto.netlify.app/cocos/).

At the end of 2024, I joined the [*MOTIVATE*](https://motivate-biodiversity.eu) project as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bologna. My task will be to model changes in plant community composition (i.e., beta diversity) and investigate the drivers of these changes within European habitats.
