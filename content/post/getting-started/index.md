## Overview

1. I'm a young vegetation scientist with a strong focus on temporal ecology. After obtaining a PhD from Roma Tre University (2020), I spent the last two years in Valencia, where I was a post-doc in [Francesco de Bello](https://functionaldiversitylab.com)'s lab at the Desertification Research Centre (Spanish National Research Council). There, I focused on understanding the mechanisms regulating the stability of plant communities. Very recently (October 2022) I landed in Brno, where I am currently an ERA fellow at Masaryk University. My research interests center on analyzing multiple facets of temporal dynamics, as well as assessing the effectiveness of protected areas on natural habitats. While being also a member of the Italian Society for Vegetation Science, I am particularly involved in the [International Association for Vegetation Science](https://www.iavs.org/default.aspx). Between 2019 and 2021 I served in the Steering Committee of the [Young Scientists](https://www.iavs.org/page/working-groups_young-scientists) working group, and I am currently chairing the [Ecoinformatics](https://www.iavs.org/page/working-groups_ecoinformatics) working group. I am also involved in the [LOTVS](https://lotvs.csic.es) initiative, a global collection of permanent vegetation plots.
