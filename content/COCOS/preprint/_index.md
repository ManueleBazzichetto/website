## A first COCOS-related preprint is out!

A first COCOS-related preprint is out on EcoEvoRXiv!

Using 11 years of data on grasslands biomass and vegetation composition, we investigated how different biodiversity facets (taxonomic and functional diversity) and plant community's dominant composition (i.e., slow- _vs_. fast- growing communities) relate to biomass resistance and recovery under extreme drought. We tested this while also accounting for the effect of land use on plant biomass production (vegetation plots used in our study are located along a gradient of land-use intensity) and considering different drought time-scales.

The key message of the paper can be summarized as follows: plant communities dominated by fast-growing species recover biomass better after severe drought, while taxonomically and functionally diverse communities resist extreme drought better. This pattern is stronger when focusing on short-term drought, i.e. the 3-months before the peak of biomass production. In the paper, we interpret this result in light of biodiversity-related mechanisms of ecosystem stability: the dominant species effect may drive biomass recovery after extreme drought, while the insurance effect may explain biomass resistance to extreme drought.
