## My participation in the IAVS symposium in Australia

The 65<sup>th</sup> symposium of the International Association for Vegetation Science took place in Coffs Harbour (New South Wales, Australia) from September 3<sup>rd</sup> to the 8<sup>th</sup> (2023). I was there with a talk to present some preliminary results from COCOS. Results were on the association between ecosystem resistance (measured from plant biomass and cover) and biodiversity (plant community's taxonomic and functional diversity, plus community weighted means of leaf traits representative of the leaf-economic spectrum) under compound dry-hot extreme events. This was the first conference where I presented the outcomes of analyses carried out using the LOTVS dataset.

As usual, I was very happy to join the IAVS congress, which is always an extremely positive and stimulating environment!

Looking forward to the next meeting in Madeira!
