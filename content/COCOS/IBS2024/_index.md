This time I played at home. I joined the 11<sup>th</sup> Conference of the International Biogeography Society, which was held in Prague (Czech Republic) in January 2024. There, I presented a poster entitled: "_Biodiversity-related mechanisms of ecosystem resistance under compound dry-hot extreme events_", which was about the association between ecosystem resistance (based on biomass and cover) and biodiversity (plant community's taxonomic and functional diversity, plus community weighted means of leaf traits representative of the leaf-economic spectrum) under compound dry-hot extreme events.
